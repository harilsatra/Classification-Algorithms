***************
* Data Format *
***************

Each line represents one data sample.
The last column of each line is class label, either 0 or 1.
The rest columns are feature values, each of them can be a real-value (continuous type) or a string (nominal type).

****************************
* K Nearest Neighbors(KNN) *
****************************

Steps to run KNN algorithm:
1. Store the knn.py file and the dataset in the same folder
2. Open terminal and run the code by typing the following command:
	
	python knn.py

3. Enter the file name of the dataset when the console prompts you to do so.
4. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-1 Measure for each fold and averages of these metrics will be displayed.

***************
* Naive Bayes *
***************

Steps to run Naive Bayes algorithm:
1. Store the nbayes.py file and the dataset in the same folder
2. Open terminal and run the code by typing the following command:
	
	python nbayes.py

3. Enter the file name of the dataset when the console prompts you to do so.
4. Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-1 Measure for each fold and averages of these metrics will be displayed.

************************
* Decision Tree (CART) *
************************
